### Defining a new algorithm 

After cloning the directory and ensuring that you can run the tests in the readme, you can make a new algorithm by running
```
cd src
source create_template.sh
```

Your analysis name should be added to the includes in: main.cc, Begin.h, Process.h, Terminate.h 

Give yourself a looper mode in AnalysisConfig.h, and an initiate in main.cc
